# Modernizing Security Assessments, System Authorizations, and Continuous Monitoring

The *Open Security Controls Assessment Language* (OSCAL) offers a number of benefits for streamlining and automating aspects of the information system authorization process. Below are just a few examples:

- **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** are able to create their FedRAMP authorization packages more rapidly and accurately, validating much of the package content before submission to agencies and FedRAMP for review.
- **Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)** are able to use OSCAL-based authorization package data to automate the planning, execution, and reporting of cloud assessment activities.
- **Agencies** are able to expedite their reviews of authorization packages.

FedRAMP expects to be able to build tooling to further reduce the cost and improve the quality of package reviews based on OSCAL data.
