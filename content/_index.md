# Modernizing Security Assessments, System Authorizations, and Continuous Monitoring

OSCAL offers a number of benefits to streamlining and automating components of the authorization process. Below are just a few examples:

- **Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)** are able to create their FedRAMP authorization packages more rapidly and accurately, validating much of their content before submission to the government for review.
- **Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs)** are able to use OSCAL-based authorization package artifacts to automate the planning, execution, and reporting of cloud assessment activities.
- **Agencies** are able to expedite their reviews of the FedRAMP authorization packages.

The FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) expects to be able to build tooling to further reduce the cost and improve the quality of package reviews.
