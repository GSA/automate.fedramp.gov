# About FedRAMP's Use of OSCAL

The Federal Risk Authorization and Management Program (FedRAMP®) is working to scale the Program’s ability to meet the needs of the market. To scale, FedRAMP needs to improve the degree of automation used to create, submit, and review packages for cloud information systems, and to continuously monitor these systems to ensure that baseline security requirements are met.

The Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) provides the capabilities needed to realize FedRAMP’s strategic objectives around automation and modernization.
