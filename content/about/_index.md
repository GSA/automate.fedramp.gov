# About FedRAMP OSCAL

FedRAMP is committed to increasing program effectiveness through automation and technology-forward operation.  OSCAL provides a means for describing system context in richer, machine-readable form, which is a key enabler for significant improvements in assessment consistency, efficiency, and accuracy.  

FedRAMP will leverage OSCAL to support machine-readable *"digital authorization packages"* and its efforts to further centralize and automate continuous monitoring activities.
