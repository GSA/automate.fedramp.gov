# OSCAL Tools

NIST has developed and maintains open source commodity tooling, applications frameworks and libraries to support working with OSCAL [see NIST OSCAL Tools web page](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/resources/tools/).  Additional open source and commercial tools are referenced on that NIST OSCAL tools web page.  

The FedRAMP automation team is working to add Metaschema-based validation mechanisms to the [OSCAL-CLI](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-cli) tool to enable it to support both core NIST OSCAL constraint validation and additional FedRAMP constraints and requirements.
