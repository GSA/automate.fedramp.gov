# FedRAMP OSCAL SSP

The following guidelines describe how to apply the OSCAL models, along with some FedRAMP-specific data requirements and extensions, to express a FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP) in OSCAL. This includes:

- An [overview](3-working-with-oscal-files) of using the OSCAL SSP model to represent a FedRAMP SSP.
- [Guidance](4-ssp-template-to-oscal-mapping) on representing FedRAMP SSP template information in OSCAL.
- Information about SSP appendices and attachments, including how to [represent some attachment information](5-attachments) in the OSCAL SSP.
- Guidance on [representing control implementation statements](6-security-controls) in an OSCAL SSP for FedRAMP.
- Using the OSCAL SSP for [generating other content artifacts](7-generated-content).

**FedRAMP extensions and allowed values are cited in relevant portions of this documentation.**
