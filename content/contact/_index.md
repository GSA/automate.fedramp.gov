# Contact Us

We want to hear from you. All development efforts have been performed openly, and we are seeking your feedback on our progress to date. Will these machine-readable formats and guidance aid your organization in going through the authorization process efficiently? Do you have any further ideas to enhance the work? Let us know!

If you have questions or feedback, please provide comments either via email to [oscal@fedramp.gov](mailto:oscal@fedramp.gov) or as a comment to an existing issue  within the [FedRAMP Automation repository](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-automation/issues).

# Mailing List

If you are interested in joining the mailing list for the FedRAMP OSCAL Implementers meetings (held biweekly on Wednesdays at noon ET), please email [oscal-implementer+subscribe@fedramp.gov](mailto:oscal-implementer+subscribe@fedramp.gov), and you will be added to the list and on the calendar invitation. The mailing list provides an opportunity for FedRAMP to reach this community without mass emails or waiting for meetings, a repository with documented responses from the FedRAMP Automation Team to group members, and a forum where individuals can support each other and ask questions.

Should you find that you are no longer interested in being a part of the mailing list, please email [oscal-implementer+unsubscribe@fedramp.gov](mailto:oscal-implementer+unsubscribe@fedramp.gov), and you will be removed.

If you have further questions, please see the email and GitHub repository links above.
