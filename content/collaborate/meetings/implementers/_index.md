## What is it?

FedRAMP [established the OSCAL Implementers meeting series in August 2024](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/pilots/digital-authorization-package/) to collaborate with participants from cloud service providers (CSPs), governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) tool providers, and federal agencies to explore the use of the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) to create machine-readable, digital authorization packages. These bi-weekly meetings allow FedRAMP staff to directly collaborate with volunteers in the [Digital Authorization Package Pilot](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/pilots/digital-authorization-package/).

## How do I join?

Participants can find meeting information by [subscribing to the mailing list](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/pilots/digital-authorization-package/#how-to-participate) and receive meeting invites.
