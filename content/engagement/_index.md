- You can participate in [pilots](https://www.fedramp.gov/fedramp-pilots/), like the [Digital Authorization Pilot](https://www.fedramp.gov/digital-authorization-package-pilot/), to use tools, data, and documentation from FedRAMP's automation portfolio, evaluate them, and to provide feedback or make changes.
- You can attend our [meetings](./meetings/) to receive briefings from FedRAMP or ask questions about the automation portfolio and related initiatives.
- You can provide feedback, propose changes, or make changes via GitHub or email. See [the contact page](../contact/) for more information.
