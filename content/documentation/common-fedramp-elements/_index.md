# Common FedRAMP Content

While each FedRAMP template has a unique purpose, they share common
information elements, such as title and publication date. These common
elements are expressed using the same OSCAL syntax for the SSP, SAP,
SAR, and POA&M. This section provides OSCAL syntax for these common
elements.
