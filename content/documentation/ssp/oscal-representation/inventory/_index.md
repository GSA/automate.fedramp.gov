# System Inventory Overview


OSCAL makes two approaches available for depicting the system inventory:

-   **Legacy/Flat Approach**: Similar to today's FedRAMP Integrated inventory workbook where all of the information on a spreadsheet row is captured in a single assembly.

-   **Component-Based Approach**: A component is defined once with as much known detail as possible, and inventory-items point to components for common information.

FedRAMP prefers the component-based approach but accepts the legacy/flat approach to aid CSPs who are converting their existing MS-Excel based FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook to OSCAL. **FedRAMP SSP tools must support both approaches.**

The [System Inventory Summary](./detail) provides an holisitc view of the legacy system inventory spreadsheet and its linkages to OSCAL content. It considers both the Legacy/Flat approach as well as the Component-based approach.
