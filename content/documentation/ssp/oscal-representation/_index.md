# SSP Template Topic Areas

Explanatory Text/Overview related to expressing a FedRAMP SSP in OSCAL.

Orientation to the use of MS Word Template images incorporated into OSCAL representations

Need to touch on:
- importing baselines
- the components overview
- the existence of topic-by-topic SSP content sections
