# FedRAMP OSCAL SAR

The following guidelines describe how to apply the OSCAL models, along with some FedRAMP-specific data requirements and extensions, to express a FedRAMP Security Assessment Results (SAR) in OSCAL. This includes:

- An [overview](3-working-with-oscal-files) of using the OSCAL SAR model to represent a FedRAMP SAR.
- [Guidance](4-sar-template-to-oscal-mapping) on representing FedRAMP SAR template information in OSCAL.
- Using the OSCAL SAR for [generating other content artifacts](5-generated-content).

**FedRAMP extensions and allowed values are cited in relevant portions of this documentation.**
